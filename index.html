                    <p class="paragraph">The Metaverse is some of the hottest tech terms in recent years. Meta Platforms, Inc. describes the metaverse as a set of virtual spaces where people can meet unphysically (Bosworth and Clegg, 2021). According to Mark Zuckerberg (2022), its key attributes are immersive and interoperability. The Metaverse is a sophisticated communication tool where you can fully immerse yourself socially, professionally, and commercially (QuHarrison et al., 2022). The Metaverse is an immersive virtual world where people have feelings of presence and see others' facial expressions (Zuckerberg, 2022). People use avatars to represent themselves in the metaverse and communicate. Currently, users can teleport in the Metaverse by putting on a VR headset.<br><br><i><b>"To put it simply, the Metaverse can be regarded as a 3D version of the internet"</b><br>(QuHarrison et al., 2022)</i></p>

                    <h2 class="subtitle">The Importance</h2>
                    <p class="paragraph">Business runs on information. The faster it's received and the more accurate it is, the better. Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger  that can be accessed only by permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts, production and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of a transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and opportunities.</p>

                    <p class="paragraph">The full name of NFTs is Non-Fungible Tokens. Non-fungible means not easy to exchange or mix with other similar goods or assets.<br><br>NFTs can define digital scarcity and value, and prove ownership. In the current digital world, it is difficult to trace owners as anyone can click to screenshot, copy and download. However, NFTs record unique identification information on the blockchain.<br><br><b><i>It enables each asset to have its unique identity, endowing the asset with unique meaning, thereby increasing its market value.</i></b></p>

                    <p class="paragraph">NFT is slightly different from cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are “ homogeneous” assets, and the value of each piece is the same; while NFT is “non-homogeneous” asset. Each one is unique.</p>

                            This type of NFT is a fusion of art and algorithm programs. Artists write a algorithm to generate different artworks.

                            NFT props really belong to players, but they only can be used in the related game currently. For example, CryotoKitties, a virtual cat game, generate cats with its own characteristics ramdomly, including different colors, pupils and cattributes. Thus, each cat is unique. Users can produce next generation by matching the cats and selling their cats in the market, some cats with rare attributes can be slod for 600ETH (about US$ 2 million). The game NFT is still in the development stage, and more changes will be in the future.
